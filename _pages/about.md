Hi, there!

<br>

I'm an Economics undergraduate at Zhejiang University and currently a visiting student at the University of Toronto. My primary research interests lie in **Empirical Industrial Organization**, **Auction Theory**, and **Mechanism Design**. I am particularly fascinated by the applications of these fields in understanding and improving market dynamics and policy-making.

<br>

I am preparing for further scholarly training in Economics after graduating in June 2025. Outside of academics, Iâ€™m also training for my first marathon. For more details, you can view my [CV here](assets/pdf/cv-myy.pdf).
